1. I have a friendly place where I can send messages to my program and see responses

    for example, I ask for a directory listing of my music directory
    I have to explicitly make the request though

2. I can create new content simply by typing

    I need to feel secure that whatever I type *won't* be sent off as a *request* (vs a message) to do other things
        - cases not covered: pasting a block of text with one line that starts with a colon

3. I can take a response and send it to another command

    for example, I can take a directory listing response and pass it to the 'find-music' command.
    I can take the output of the 'find-music' command and write it to a file


    "forwarding" ?

    responses are nothing fancy, they're just plain values. 
    in this case, taking an output value and using it as input is just creating a segment of pipe.
    the input service may not be compatible with the response
    
    in a gui, I could select an item and then perform actions on it
    in the repl I can store the result and use that, programmatically
    so in a CLI, how do I 'select' results?
        - the last result could be automatically selected. this is a solid mental model
        - there could be a command to use an arbitrarily old result
    in a CLI, how do I use a service with a result
        - threaded, like in clojure with -> and ->> ?
            - -> :topic-kw args => (:topic-kw result args)
            - urgh, more syntax
        - howabout
            - :forward :topic-kw any other args
            - which will call a 'forward' service that takes the topic to forward to, the last response and any further args
        - in which case, we need something heftier than an offtopic recorder
            - the cli will need a 'cli-recorder'
                - really? this will tie the cli to this forward service
            - global response register?
                - all responses to everything are stored in memory
                    - I guess we could tune this as well. the last five responses. N amount of memory...

4. I can filter the contents of a response and have it available as another dataset that can be used

    for example, I can take a directory listing response of my music directory and exclude all top level files leaving only directories
    the original response is unmodified and the filtered dataset is a new response


    ok, in keeping with #1 and #3 where we have a friendly place to send messages and then re-use responses,
    this would be a service that takes the last result (like :forward) and transforms it somehow (filter/map/reduce) and returns a new thing
    
    given the example, a command list like this might work:
        :dir-list /my/music/dir
            => directory-listing shape, files and directories
        :|filter :only-dirs
            => directory-listing shape, directories only

5. I can navigate previous responses and mux them into a new one

    for example, I can take the filtered directory listing and *another* filtered directory listing and create a single listing
    I can then pass this composite result to the 'find-music' command (as per 2)
    
    
    lets ignore interactive navigation of previous responses for now
    we now need a service that knows how to select and slice the :results-list

    given the example, if there were two previous responses and we wanted a new, composite, third result
        :dir-list /my/music/dir
        :dir-list /my/other/music/dir
        :select -2
            => selects last two results and returns a new composite result


6. I can join responses/content together
    
    for example, I've just joined N number of previous results in to a single new result
    I want a single list of results, not a nested list of results.
    
    using the example above, we would get a single list of all music directories in those two directories
    
    
    could this be as a parameter to :select ?
        :select all :as-one true

    lets avoid parameters to things and keep them shallow.
    perhaps
        :|unnest
    which is better than 'shallow-flatten' I suppose

7. For any response, I can find a list of services that will accept it as input. Even if more inputs are required.

    this is a big task, I blanche everytime I read it.

    - every service will need to advertise it's arguments or be introspectable enough to nab them
    - every service will need to be specced
    - we'll lose a lot of the flexibility that comes with having a service be a simple function accepting a message
        - and services accept messages, not responses!
    - can this be something that is layered on top of existing message-based services?
        - for example, a service is registered with an optional parser
            - the parser takes a message and produces an output of it's advertised type or nil
            - if nil, the next parser is tried
            - if no parsers succeed, the message is discarded
            - otherwise, the parsed args are provided in the message and the message passed to the service
        - so, this is akin to dispatch or a single function having multiple signatures?
            - ok, ignore multiple parsers, just have a single parser per service
                - like a :pre metadata function?
                    - lets stay away from metadata
            - then we have a service and a preprocessor that advertises it's services
                - it's not even a 'preprocessor', it's a simple predicate that, given a bit of data returns true if the service will accept it
                    - and by default all services accept any input
                        
    - so, every service can now specify a function that returns true or false if it can parse the given input
        - it is true by default
        - it may use spec, it may not
        - it is not intended to replace message parsing 
        - it is intended to be a quick yes or no 

8. ~For any response+service match, I can send the response to that service and be prompted for missing inputs~

    'prompted for missing inputs'
        - that's a little audacious.
        - it depends on the service signature, which is simply 'msg'
        - dropping requirement.
            - the service will fail like usual if all of the arguments are not there
            - this does mean that those services who rely on on other arguments in the message itself (rather than the body) will break
    
    ...
        - can't I already send the response to that service simply by calling that service without args?
            - like:
                :service
                
                ?

9. I can store any result permanently on disk and this store is available on startup

    For example, the results-list is ephemeral and will disappear between application restarts. 
    I want some results to stick around to examine later. Or to mux with the next day's results.
    

    'some' results. the only state worth saving is the :results-list and possibly the CLI interaction session
        - ignoring any cli sessions for now, there may still be other data to restore in the future
            - so a general 'load' and 'save' interface is required that slices and merges the bits of state we're interested in
        - loading and saving should be tied to application start and stop
            - on start, load data, if it exists
            - on stop, preserve data, if it exists
                - even if empty data wipes out a full list?
                    - yup
        - serialisation format?
            - edn?
                - we could use read-string I suppose
            - json?
                - sure? there is coercing to and from though
                    - this could be seen as positive pressure to keep data simple
                    - we'll also be storing deeply nested structures that we won't know how to restore properly from strings
                        - providing a per-type or per-service deserialiser of results could get bothersome quickly
            - csv
                - don't be ridiculous
            - other
                - nippy?
                    - sure? so long as we stick to it's supported data types
                        - https://github.com/ptaoussanis/nippy#deserializing
            - database?
                - sqlite/sql?
                    - same as json I suppose, except worse as we would have database tables
                        - we could store everything flat, but then, why even bother
                - neo4j
                    - is is java based
                    - I do want to do ER stuff in the immediate future
                    - how much data coercion will there be?
                    - we have NeoCons and neo4j-clj
                        - neocons uses HTTP and REST to communicate, authentication
                            - these are all overheads to an embedded database
                        - neo4j-clj 
                            - nobody mentioned neo4j when I brought it up. huh

                - datahike
                    - datahike is an unstable fork of datascript using a sexy new backend. 
                    - will leave it alone for the time being

                - datascript
                    - has queries-as-structs rather than strings
                    - I guess I want to store a blob of misc data with certain attributes picked out and then recall it all when querying
                        - and I want this in a node-relationship form so I can search across relations

                - crux
                    - good vibe. 
                        - I like the writing style
                        - I like that it supports a bag of data ('schemaless') that can be queried across
                        - I like the idea of bi-temporality: valid-time and transaction time
                            - it's a bit like NiFi and it's data provenance
                        - I can see how to find things and then fetch the full thing
                            - https://opencrux.com/docs#_introduction_2
                            - the two-step fetch is a bit eh, but I may just be used to databases and 'select * where ...' queries
                        - I'm not sure about the quoted queries vs simple query strings
                            - but if you are building up queries using data, then quoting makes sense for variables
                        - no idea on speed or actual practical day to day usage
                            - maps and lists handling here

                - gremlin+ogre
                    - gremlin is the query language
                    - ogre is ... also the query language?
                        - it's a clojure library that uses gremlin
                    - tinkerpop is a framework over a graph database
                    - but I can use ogre by itself for in-memory representations
                    - ...
                        - this feels like classic java overengineering and death by a thousand abstractions
                
                - asami
                    - in-memory implementation of a storage protocol called 'Naga'
                    - Naga allows us to 'load' data and craft rules about the nature of the data to derive new information
                        - like a predicate logic system
                    - bit more academic than gremlin+ogre and not what I'm aiming for
                    
                    
                - lets take a closer look at crux
            


10. I can take any thing and classify it as a thing

    For example, I can take a list of random strings and call it a 'directory listing'.
    Such a thing as a 'directory listing' may not exist.
    Or, a 'directory listing' may exist, but what we were just given isn't what we consider to be a valid directory listing.
    Because a directory listing has rules and if all of the rules are followed it is valid.

11. I can take any two things and give them a named relationship
